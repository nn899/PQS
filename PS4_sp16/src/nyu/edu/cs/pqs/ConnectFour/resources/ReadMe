The game is played by two players who alternate dropping chips into a 7-column, 6-row grid. 
The first player to get 4 in a row wins.
When playing in Double Player mode, two windows pop up on top of each other.
Please move top window to side to be able to view both windows.

The test cases pass when run independently.
If all 6 JUnit test classes are executed together, some test cases may fail.
